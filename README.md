# dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles I use for my standard linux installations.

The dotfiles include:
* vim config and vim plugins
* tmux configuration
* custom bash aliases and options
* the bash scripts I use and have added to PATH

In order to install them, I run the **install.sh** script.

**NOTE**: I usually use this as a supplemental repository to my [ubuntu-install](https://github.com/preslavmihaylov/ubuntu-install) repo.  
In it, you will find a script for installing all the software I use on my Ubuntu machines.  
Some of the features here might not work properly without the tools installed from the other repo.
